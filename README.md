# Galaxy Morphology 

Code for the website www.galaxyml.uk and for the related MNRAS paper: An automatic taxonomy of galaxy morphology using unsupervised machine learning 

This repository contains source code for multi-threaded versions of several machine learning algorithms.

The C# code analyses FITS survey images.

The website is a Java Spring Boot web app with REST api for galaxy similarity search. The website uses an in-memory cache of the galaxy catalogue for performance. 

The C# source code can be compiled with Visual Studio 2015.

For the Java site & REST api I use IntelliJ.
